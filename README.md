# SimpleSock
a simple UI for Wiresock/Wireshark

* Provides a minimalistic graphical user interface for initiating a VPN connection to a Wireshark network.
* The interface is confined to a tray icon in the Windows taskbar, enabling users to select and initiate predefined VPN connections.
* It necessitates the installation of WireSock, which is automatically deployed via WinGet if not already present on the host system.
